---@class BootstrapOptions
---@field timeout number A number of seconds before ending a bootstrap attempt as unsuccessful. Recreate the cluster in case of bootstrap timeout.
---@field if_not_bootstrapped boolean  By default is set to false that means raise an error, when the cluster is already bootstrapped. True means consider an already bootstrapped cluster a success.

--- Perform the initial cluster bootstrap and distribute all buckets across the replica sets.
--- 
--- **Note:**
--- To detect whether a cluster is bootstrapped, vshard looks for at least one bucket in the whole cluster.
--- If the cluster was bootstrapped only partially (for example, due to an error during the first bootstrap),
--- then it will be considered a bootstrapped cluster on a next bootstrap call with if_not_bootstrapped.
--- So this is still a bad practice. Avoid calling bootstrap() multiple times.

---The function implements consistent map-reduce over the entire cluster.
---
---**Consistency means:**
--- - All the data was accessible.
--- - The data was not migrated between physical storages during the map requests execution.
---
--- **The function can be helpful if you need to access:**
--- - All the data in the cluster
--- - A vast number of buckets scattered over the instances in case their individual `vshard.router.call()` takes up too much time

---Logs a warning when used because it is not consistent for cdata numbers
---In particular, it returns 3 different values for normal Lua numbers like 123, for unsigned long long cdata (like `123ULL`, or `ffi.cast('unsigned long long',123)`), and for signed long long cdata (like `123LL`, or `ffi.cast('long long', 123)`).

function router.bucket_id(key) end

---Calculate the bucket id using a simple built-in hash function
---
--- In particular, it returns 3 different values for normal Lua numbers like 123, for unsigned long long cdata (like 123ULL, or ffi.cast('unsigned long long',123)), and for signed long long cdata (like 123LL, or ffi.cast('long long', 123))
--- For float and double cdata (`ffi.cast('float', number)`, `ffi.cast('double', number)`) these functions return different values even for the same numbers of the same floating point type. This is because `tostring()` on a floating point cdata number returns not the number, but a pointer at it. Different on each call
---@param key number|string|table A hash key. This can be any Lua object (number, table, string).
---@return number bucket_id A bucket identifier
function router.bucket_id_strcrc32(key) end

---This function is safer than bucket_id_strcrc32. It takes a CRC32 from a MessagePack encoded value. That is, bucket id of integers does not depend on their Lua type. In case of a string key, it does not encode it into MessagePack, but takes a hash right from the string
---
---However it still may return different values for not equal floating point types. That is, `ffi.cast('float', number)` may be reflected into a bucket id not equal to `ffi.cast('double', number)`. This can’t be fixed, because a float value, even being casted to double, may have a garbage tail in its fraction.
---Floating point keys should not be used to calculate a bucket id, usually.
---Be very careful in case you store floating point types in a space. When data is returned from a space, it is cast to Lua number. And if that value had an empty fraction part, it will be treated as an integer by `bucket_id_mpcrc32()`. So you need to do explicit casts in such case

---Force wakeup of the bucket discovery fiber
function router.discovery_wakeup() end

---Turn on/off the background discovery fiber used by the router to find buckets
---
---The method is good to enable/disable discovery after the router is already started, but discovery is enabled by default. You may want to never enable it even for a short time—then specify the discovery_mode option in the configuration. It takes the same values as `vshard.router.discovery_set(mode)`.
---You may decide to turn off discovery or make it once if you have many routers, or tons of buckets (hundreds of thousands and more), and you see that the discovery process consumes notable CPU % on routers and storages. In that case it may be wise to turn off the discovery when there is no rebalancing in the cluster. And turn it on for new routers, as well as for all routers when rebalancing is started

---Since vshard v.0.1.21. Manually allow access to the router API, revert `vshard.router.disable()`. It is cannot be used for enabling a router API that was automatically disabled due to a running configuration process
function router.enable() end

---Since vshard v.0.1.21. Manually restrict access to the router API. When the API is disabled, all its methods throw a Lua error, except `vshard.router.cfg()`, `vshard.router.new()`, `vshard.router.enable()` and `vshard.router.disable()`. The error object’s name attribute is ROUTER_IS_DISABLED.
---The router is enabled by default. However, it is automatically and forcefully disabled until the configuration is finished, as accessing the router’s methods at that time is not safe.
---Manual disabling can be used, for example, if some preparatory work needs to be done after calling `vshard.router.cfg()` but before the router’s methods are available
---
---**Example:**
---```
--- vshard.router.disable()
--- vshard.router.cfg(...)
--- -- Some preparatory work here ...
--- vshard.router.enable()
--- -- vshard.router's methods are available now
---```
function router.disable() end

---Automated master discovery works in its own fiber on a router, which is activated only if at least one replica set is configured to look for the master (the master parameter is set to auto). The fiber wakes up within a certain period. But it is possible to wake it up on demand by using this function.
---Manual fiber wakeup can help speed up tests for master change. Another use case is performing some actions with a router in the router console.
---The function does nothing if master search is not configured for any replica set.
