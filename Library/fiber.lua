---A fiber is a set of instructions which are executed with cooperative multitasking.
---Fibers managed by the fiber module are associated with a user-supplied function called the fiber function.
---A fiber has three possible states, detectable by fiber.status(): running, suspended or dead.
---When a fiber is created with fiber.create(), it is running.
---When a fiber is created with fiber.new() or yields control with fiber.sleep(), it is suspended.
---When a fiber ends (because the fiber function ends), it is dead.
---All fibers are part of the fiber registry.
---This registry can be searched with fiber.find() - via fiber id (fid), which is a numeric identifier.
---A runaway fiber can be stopped with fiber_object.cancel.
---However, fiber_object.cancel is advisory — it works only if the runaway fiber calls fiber.testcancel() occasionally.
---Most box.* functions, such as box.space…delete() or box.space…update(), do call fiber.testcancel() but box.space…select{} does not.
---In practice, a runaway fiber can only become unresponsive if it does many computations and does not check whether it has been cancelled.
---Like all Lua objects, dead fibers are garbage collected.
---The Lua garbage collector frees pool allocator memory owned by the fiber, resets all fiber data,
---and returns the fiber (now called a fiber carcass) to the fiber pool.
---The carcass can be reused when another fiber is created.
---A fiber has all the features of a Lua coroutine and all the programming concepts
---that apply for Lua coroutines will apply for fibers as well.
---However, Tarantool has made some enhancements for fibers and has used fibers internally.
---So, although use of coroutines is possible and supported, use of fibers is recommended.

---
---Joining will cause a yield, therefore, if the fiber is currently in a suspended state, execution of its fiber function will resume.
---
---This kind of waiting is more convenient than going into a loop and periodically checking the status;
---
---however, it works only if the fiber was created with `fiber.new()` and was made joinable with `fiber_object:set_joinable()`.
